    Peanut for Life, a food manufacturer, seeks to produce a chanachur snack product comprising three mixtures: puffed rice, nuts and cereal. Each ingredient mixture has a different cost per kilogram (see Table \ref{costs}); therefore, Peanut for Life is aiming to minimise the total cost of each package of chanachur by formulating a linear programming model.
