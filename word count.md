1 Product Composition Peanut for Life, a food manufacturer, seeks to produce a chanachur snack product comprising three mixtures: puffed rice, nuts and cereal. Each mixture has a different cost per kilogram (see Table 1); therefore, Peanut for Life is aiming to minimise the total cost of each package of chanachur by formulating a linear programming model.

If x1, x2 and x3 represent the weight (in kilograms) of puffed rice, nuts and cereal respectively, then the total cost of one package of chanachur would be: total cost = 0.35x1 + 0.5x2 + 0.2x3 (1) The objective is to minimise this quantity. However, there is not just the cost to consider. Peanut for Life must also ensure the product is commercially viable by ensuring it is both nutritionally balanced and attractive to consumers. To this end, the following constraints on the final composition are given: • The chanachur package must hold between 3 and 4 cups of product. • One package cannot contain more than 1000 calories in food energy. • One package cannot contain more than 25 grams of fat. • At least 20% of the product volume must comprise puffed rice mixture. • No more than 15% of the product weight may comprise nuts. Using the nutritional information provided in Table 2, these constraints may be modelled mathematically as inequalities 2 to 7.
