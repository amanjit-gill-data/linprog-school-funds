## ideas

introduce a <u>new</u> fund - two hours of ES salary per qualifying student (number of qualifying students is estimated from naplan)
justify the need for this - find evidence/articles on lack of support staff etc

to calculate total pool of money:
- find out how much govt funding the local private schools are getting
- for each school, find the differencegit  between the SRS and how much the school is getting 
- this difference is the funding redistribute this as my new fund

~~**maybe <u>just</u> focus on the SRP catch-up loading
see if using the latest NAPLAN rather than year 5 changes how this loading is applied**
but I can't compare this to the current system because there's no breakdown of SRP equity funding - can't see how much of each school's equity funding is catch-up loading

~~allocation of funding to schools, or school regions

~~assignment of literacy/numeracy grants to schools within a certain area (limit to a suburb or city)

~~wholsale redistribution of education funding across the whole system
- ~~ask for naplan data
- ~~look for school funding data

## research

#### overview and school search

so demographic data are mostly used?
would using actual performance data affect the allocation?

#### govt guide on funding allocation

https://www.education.vic.gov.au/PAL/student-resource-package-indicative-guide-2023.pdf

two branches of funding:
- core student learning allocation funding
- equity funding

![[Pasted image 20230215051838.png | 600]]
so NAPLAN is used - except the year 5 result is always used, even 6 years later in year 12
this seems crude
would it make a difference to take the latest NAPLAN instead?

this is a pull-out-of-class program
but there is a shortage of ES staff working with kids in their normal classes
that's why my idea is different to the TLI

funding for ES staff is currently part of the PSD (program for students with disabilities)
the PSD fund can be used for:
![[Pasted image 20230215054050.png | 600]]
an amount is given for each student who qualifies, so it is targeted to individual students

but the issues with the PSD are:
- there's no dedicated funding for ES staff; the block of funding is shared across multiple expenditures
- PSD is for students with high needs, but there are lots and lots of students who wouldn't qualify but who are regularly underperforming and behind
	- strict criteria with diagnoses [[psdguidelines.docx]]
	- but i know my school was stretching the ES staff for the funded kids across the unfunded ones too
- schools with PSD funding get less catch-up funding

my idea can improve things because it focuses on performance, to capture all kids who need support, not the just ones with a moderate-severe diagnosis, due to
- poor exec function due to adhd (not mentioned in the PSD criteria and guidelines at all!) - find stats for prevalence of adhd in population AND effect of ADHD on student performance (research papers)
- trauma background (this is not captured by the demographic data used for other equity loadings)
- family problems (also not directly captured, other than financial hardship)
- mental illness

but how, if the funding isn't there??

education research paper

public schools only get 91% of their SRS at best
private schools get *over* 100%

this is shocking

this passge has the base amount
but remember, govt schools only get 20% of this amount

SRS had additional loadings for
