## advice from webinar

- assignment advice
	- include title page!!
	- mostly similar instructions to assignment 2
	- use <u>applied research</u>, not <u>basic research</u>
	- if task3 problem involves uncertainty, must use simulations (week 6)
	- model = objective function, decision variables, constraints clearly defined
	- recommend using only parts 1 and 2 of the submission thing
		- i.e. report in part 1, spreadsheet in part 2
		- then nothing in parts 3 and 4
	- justify why it's a prescriptive analytics problem and why it needs linear programming or whatever method i chose

## report checklist

#### abstract 200
- [ ] Accurately and succinctly summarises contents of the report.
- [ ] Gives the reader an excellent understanding of the report purpose and content.
- [ ] Provide a hint of managerial implication at the bottom end of the abstract.

#### introduction 500
- [ ] Explains purpose of report
	- [x] algorithm for allocating funding for more support for kids struggling at school
- [ ] Describes scope and limitations of report
	- [x] only my local area, otherwise too many schools
	- [ ] only high schools or p-12s; data can't be separated which skews the analysis
	- [x] also there is a lot of variation between LGAs so keeping it to Casey removes that
	- [ ] limitation is that certain data isn't publicly available e.g. proportion of kids falling behind at each school; may be available by application but time constraints
- [ ] Describes methods/sources used to gather information
	- [ ] govt policies and guidelines, federal and state
	- [ ] govt funding data per school
	- [ ] research into whether ES has an impact and is worth funding more
- [ ] Provides necessary background information to situate readers
	- [x] teaching staff to student ratio is same, but non-teaching staff to student ratio is very different
	- [ ] this shows that public funding of ES might not be keeping up with demand
		- [x] how funding works
		- [ ] some students aren't covered e.g. adhd, ACEs
		- [ ] ACEs --> executive functioning problems, school performance impacts
		- [ ] adhd --> severe impacts on education
		- [ ] so they need more ES 
		- [ ] there's the TLI but research shows negative impact; better to have ES embedded in classrooms
		- [ ] to that end, i have this funding idea
	- [ ] in my local area, public schools' naplan performance is clearly worse
	- [ ] vce study score is lower
- [ ] Offers a preview of the findings
	- [ ] increased support can be provided at a very low cost compared to the excess funding provided to private schools

#### problem definition 600
- [ ] Addresses a wide range of articles/papers.
- [ ] Succinctly presents the findings from the review
- [ ] Indicates that the presenter is very well versed with the topic.
- [ ] Extensive illustration on how this problem is related to the Prescriptive decision analytics and why.

#### solution approach 400
- [ ] Can propose the appropriate methodology to address the problem.
- [ ] Can explain why it is appropriate and other methodologies are not suitable.
- [ ] Can explain the methodology mathematically or in words.
- [ ] Can suggest the possible results and outcomes.
- [ ] Can interpret the results.
- [ ] Do have a qualitative analysis against comparing methods or approaches

#### interpretation of results 850
- [ ] Excellent documentation of the results.
- [ ] Different performance measures are used to validate the proposed model.
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis was carried out to justify the robustness of the model.
- [ ] Excellent comparison with the current practice and/or alternative methodologies.
- [ ] Perfect focus on the achievements.
- [ ] Detailed discussion about any possible limitations of the assumed problem.

#### conclusion 200
- [ ] Conclusions and related outcomes (consequences and implications) are logical and reflect student’s informed evaluation and ability to place evidence and perspectives discussed in priority order.

#### references
- [ ] The report follows a referencing style that complies with the Harvard style, and the in-text citations are made purposefully.
- [ ] Reference list is completely accurate with no errors.
