## report checklist

#### abstract 200
- [ ] Accurately and succinctly summarises contents of the report.
- [ ] Gives the reader an excellent understanding of the report purpose and content.
- [ ] Provide a hint of managerial implication at the bottom end of the abstract.

#### introduction 500
- [x] Explains purpose of report
	- [x] algorithm for allocating funding for more support for kids struggling at school
- [x] Describes scope and limitations of report
	- [x] only my local area, otherwise too many schools
	- [x] also there is a lot of variation between LGAs so keeping it to Casey removes that
	- [x] limitation is that certain data isn't publicly available e.g. proportion of kids falling behind at each school; may be available by application but time constraints
	- [x] another limitation is missing values
	- [x] another limitation is inability to separate primary from secondary data in p-12 schools
- [x] Describes methods/sources used to gather information
	- [x] govt policies and guidelines, federal and state
	- [x] govt funding data per school
	- [x] research into whether ES has an impact and is worth funding more
- [x] Provides necessary background information to situate readers
	- [x] teaching staff to student ratio is same, but non-teaching staff to student ratio is very different
	- [x] this shows that public funding of ES might not be keeping up with demand
		- [x] how funding works
		- [x] some students aren't covered e.g. adhd, ACEs
		- [x] ACEs --> executive functioning problems, school performance impacts
		- [x] adhd --> severe impacts on education
- [x] Offers a preview of the findings
	- [x] increased support can be provided at a very low cost compared to the excess funding provided to private schools

#### problem definition 600
- [x] Addresses a wide range of articles/papers.
	- [x] PSD is anadequate because it misses a bunch of kids as discussed in intro
	- [x] there's the TLI but research shows negative impact; better to have ES embedded in classrooms
	- [x] private schools have more non-teaching staff
	- [x] all this is why there's a problem
- [x] Succinctly presents the findings from the review
- [x] Indicates that the presenter is very well versed with the topic.
- [x] Extensive illustration on how this problem is related to the Prescriptive decision analytics and why.

#### solution approach 400
- [x] Can propose the appropriate methodology to address the problem.
	- [x] no data on proportion of students who need more support
	- [x] but in my local area, public schools' naplan performance is clearly worse
	- [x] and vce study score is lower
	- [x] so i can use this to assess the schools on their need
- [x] Can explain why it is appropriate and other methodologies are not suitable.
	- [x] goal programming not appropriate as this a limited-scope problem - funding for only one program; if it were the whole education budget it would potentially be a goal programming problem
	- [x] binary programming not suitable as it doesn't differentiate between high and low needs.
- [x] Can explain the methodology mathematically or in words.
- [x] Can suggest the possible results and outcomes.
- [x] Can interpret the results.
- [x] Do have a qualitative analysis against comparing methods or approaches

#### interpretation of results 850
- [x] Excellent documentation of the results.
- [x] Different performance measures are used to validate the proposed model
	- [x] how much smaller cost than budgeted

- [x] Sensitivity analysis was carried out to justify the robustness of the model.
	- [x] check sensitivity to different staff facilities limit, ES staff ratio, academic deficit score
- [x] Excellent comparison with the current practice and/or alternative methodologies.
	- [x] current practice doesn't allocate to adhd, aces; uses a loading system that seems good but still falls short
	- [x] current practice doesn't specifically fund ES - it's part of a pool of money the school can use for whatever
- [x] Perfect focus on the achievements.
- [x] Detailed discussion about any possible limitations of the assumed problem.

	- [x] doesn't provision extra collaboration time between teachers and ES as advocated for my study
	- [x] so a second iteration of the analysis could work in extra planning allotments for ES, and perhaps slightly reduced workload for teachers so they can liaise with ES, and more funding for training ES and issuing them equipment, which isn't guaranteed




#### conclusion 200
- [x] Conclusions and related outcomes (consequences and implications) are logical and reflect student’s informed evaluation and ability to place evidence and perspectives discussed in priority order.

#### references
- [x] The report follows a referencing style that complies with the Harvard style, and the in-text citations are made purposefully.
- [x] Reference list is completely accurate with no errors.
