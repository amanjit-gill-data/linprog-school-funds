The purpose of this analysis is to assess and shortlist the most dangerous road locations in Victoria, and then to use a multi-criteria decision analytics approach to select the location that is most in need of major redevelopment.

The impetus for this undertaking came from an observation that was recently made in the author's locality in Victoria. This observation was of a local road and intersection that have undergone a costly, time-consuming and disruptive reconstruction process (XXXX), only to appear, at the conclusion of these works, to have changed very little in terms of both function and appearance.

The road and intersection in question have never been marked by severe traffic congestion or frequent collisions. Publicly available data show that the intersection, denoted in records by the identifier 332806, was involved in only 4 collisions in the five-year period to June 2020 (XXXX). Furthermore, the government has not published - or validated - the process by which this location was prioritised.

By contrast, the method proposed in the present analysis, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), has been validated as an approach to road infrastructure planning by researchers. Among them, XXXX (XXXX) demonstrates the use of the analytical heirarchy process (AHP) to assess and prioritise road surface repairs, and XXXX (XXXX) demonstrates a hybrid approach combining multi-criteria and cost-benefit analyses. In addition, XXXX (XXXX) validates the applicability of SMART (simple multi-attribute rating technique) across a broad range of technical and planning activities.

The present analysis is, however, limited in that an exhaustive investigation and primary data collection cannot be done due to time and budget constraints. Because of this, care has been taken to only select attributes about which information is already available, while ensuring that the main causes of road risk are adequately covered. To this end, the author has made use of data published online by government bodies, either as downloadable data files or as interactive web applications.

Despite these limitations, a considerable amount of relevant data have been found, leading to the shortlisting and subsequent selection of a road location that is most in need of redevelopment. Furthermore, the process has been found to be robust against changes. It is hoped that this analysis can provide a blueprint from which the Victorian government may make sound, evidence-based, planning decisions.


## Problem Identification

- [x] Addresses a wide range of articles/papers.
- [x] Succinctly presents the findings from the review.
- [x] Indicates that the presenter is very well versed with the topic. 
- [x] Extensive illustration on how this problem is related to the quantitative decision analytics and why.

The identification of road improvement as a suitable subject for a decision analytics problem came about as a result of the author's failure to locate information justifying the major reconstruction works being undertaken at the intersection mentioned earlier. 

Attempts were made to establish the rationale for the Victorian government's decision to redevelop this road and intersection. These attempts have been fruitless; the only available information pertains to the purported benefits of the project, and a discussion of some community consultation that occurred after a commitment was already made to proceed (XXXX). 

This was followed by an examination of Victorian government websites, in order to find the following:

- a list of "black spot" intersections; these are intersections that are marked as particularly dangerous, which are sometimes allocated funding for improvement works by the federal government (XXXX)

- any form of analysis or documentation, such as a cost-benefit analysis or a business case, that explains how and why any road project has been approved in recent years

While they may be publicly available, none of these documents could be found within a reasonable amount of time. There is documentation on the processes that VicRoads, the body responsible for smaller projects like the installation of safety barriers, uses when identifying and prioritising potential targets for improvement (XXXX). These guidelines are comprehensive and include an exhaustive list of criteria and metrics by which to assess road locations. However, major redevelopments are not within the scope of VicRoads' work; therefore, it is not apparent that this document has been used in the major construction works this analysis is centred on.

From the above, it is apparent that the government does provide information about the benefits of major improvement works, but only after it has committed the resources. Additionally, while there is some information - through VicRoads - about the processes the government might use, there is no publicly available evidence of their use in specific projects.

It is this absence of evidence of a methodical approach to roadwork prioritisation that motivates the present analysis. MCDM has already been endorsed for its utility in transport planning projects. Of particular note is the encouragement of MCDM methods by Infrastructure Australia (XXXX) and the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads (XXXX), both of which have published detailed technical guidelines on assessing projects. In addition, research such as that by XXXX (XXXX), wherein multi-criteria methods are used to prioritise repairs to a large number of rural roads, as well as the studies mentioned earlier by XXXX (XXXX) and XXXX (XXXX), comprehensively build the case for Victorian adoption of MCDM in road infrastructure planning.

However, the aforementioned studies involve extensive data collection and the use of specialised equipment to quantify the specified attributes; by contrast, the author of the present study seeks to show that a desktop analysis, relying only on data that are already available, can be a capable and efficient stand-in when resources are constrained.
