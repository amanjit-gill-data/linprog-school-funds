The purpose of this analysis is to assess and shortlist the most dangerous road locations in Victoria, and then to use a multi-criteria decision analytics approach to select the location that is most in need of redevelopment.

The impetus for this undertaking came from an observation that was recently made in the author's locality in Victoria. This observation was of a local road and intersection that have undergone a costly, time-consuming and disruptive reconstruction process (XXXX), only to appear, at the conclusion of these works, to have changed very little in terms of both function and appearance.

The road and intersection in question have never been marked by severe traffic congestion or frequent collisions. Publicly available data show that the intersection, denoted in records by the identifier 332806, was involved in only 4 collisions in the five-year period to June 2020 (XXXX). While the Victorian government has documented the purported benefits of the project (XXXX), it has not published the process by which this location was prioritised ahead of others. 

It is hoped that this independent analysis, to identify roads that should be prioritised for redevelopment, can provide a blueprint from which the Victorian government may make sound, evidence-based, planning decisions in the future.










## Problem Identification

- [ ] Addresses a wide range of articles/papers.
- [ ] Succinctly presents the findings from the review.
- [ ] Indicates that the presenter is very well versed with the topic. 
- [ ] Extensive illustration on how this problem is related to the quantitative decision analytics and why.



vicroads has a detailed benefit management framework, including an extensive list of metrics for evaluating criteria, but documentation of this being applied to specific projects is either not available to the public, or difficult to find

vic big build only discusses benefits, not how the locations are chosen over others

so overall, there's general discussion of how projects are chosen, but very little on how specific projects were chosen



## Solution Approach

- [ ] Can propose the appropriate methodology to address the problem.
- [ ] Can explain why it is appropriate and other methodologies are not suitable.
- [ ] Can explain the methodology mathematically or in words.

- [ ] Can suggest the possible results and outcomes.
- [ ] Can interpret the results.
- [ ] Do have a qualitative analysis against comparing methods or approaches




## Results

- [ ] Excellent documentation of the results.

- [ ] Different performance measures are used to validate the proposed model.

- [ ] Sensitivity analysis was carried out to justify the robustness of the models.

- [ ] Excellent comparison with the current practice and/or alternative methodologies.

- [ ] Perfect focus on the achievements.

- [ ] Detailed discussion about any possible limitations of the assumed problem.



## Conclusion

- [ ] Conclusions and related outcomes (consequences and implications) are logical and reflect student's informed evaluation and ability to place evidence and perspectives discussed in priority order.
