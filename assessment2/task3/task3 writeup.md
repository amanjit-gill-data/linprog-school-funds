## Problem Identification

- [ ] Addresses a wide range of articles/papers.

- [ ] Succinctly presents the findings from the review.
- [ ] Indicates that the presenter is very well versed with the topic. 
- [ ] Extensive illustration on how this problem is related to the quantitative decision analytics and why.

The impetus for an exploration of how governments might choose between infrastructure projects came from an observation that was recently made in the author's locality in Victoria. This observation was of a local road and an intersection that have undergone a costly, time-consuming and expensive reconstruction process (XXXX), only to appear, at the conclusion of these works, to have changed very little in terms of both function and appearance.

The road and intersection in question have never been marked by severe traffic congestion or frequent collisions. Publicly available data on road accidents show that this intersection, at the corner of Narre Warren North and Ernst Wanke Roads in outer south-east Melbourne, was involved in only 4 collisions in the five-year period to June 2020 (XXXX). This begs the question; how was this intersection, and the section of Narre Warren North Rd it is located on, selected for such an extensive redevelopment?

It is with this case study in mind that the present analysis has been conducted. The aim is to assess and shortlist the most dangerous road locations in Victoria, and then use a decision analytics approach to select the location that is most in need of redevelopment.

vicroads has a detailed benefit management framework, including an extensive list of metrics for evaluating criteria, but documentation of this being applied to specific projects is either not available to the public, or difficult to find

vic big build only discusses benefits, not how the locations are chosen over others

so overall, there's general discussion of how projects are chosen, but very little on how specific projects were chosen
