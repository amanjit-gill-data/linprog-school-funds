Danaos Corporation has secured office space at Karabar; however, the QueanBeyan and Palerang Regional Council (QPRC) would like to acquire this site and has offered Danaos Corporation a choice of four alternative sites.

(a)

To decide between these four sites, as well as the original site at Karabar, the CEO of Danaos Corporation has identified a number of attributes (criteria), and assigned them weights to convey their relative importance. These weights have been normalised as shown in Table XXXX.

In addition, the CEO has scored each of the five sites for their performance on the specified attributes. These have been used, in conjunction with the aforementioned weights, to calculate a weighted sum of all the scores for each alternative. These weighted sums represent the aggregate benefit of leasing the sites, and are shown in Table XXXX.

Following this, itemised costs that were provided by the CEO have been aggregated to give the overall cost for each site (refer to Table XXXX). When the aggregate benefits for the alternative sites are plotted against their costs, an efficient frontier becomes apparent, as seen in Figure XXXX.

This efficient frontier connects the sites that dominate the others. There are two sites in contention for selection: Isabella St and Karabar. Although Isabella St is much cheaper than Karabar, it also represents a heavy drop in benefit value. Given that the CEO was already content with paying for Karabar, the recommendation is to remain at Karabar.

If the efficient frontier is discarded and all the data points are placed back into contention, then it is clear that moving to any of the four alternative sites would represent a significant drop in benefit value. This validates the recommendation to remain at Karabar.

(b)

If the CEO decides to move to a different site, then it should be noted that all four sites have a benefit value somewhere between 55 and 60, making them all similar in this regard. However, they are markedly diverse in terms of cost.

QueanBeyan would be more expensive than Karabar, for a smaller benefit, and should be disregarded immediately. Of the remaining choices, Isabella St is both the cheapest and the most beneficial. Therefore, the recommendation is to choose Isabella St.


(c)

Sensitivity analyses have been undertaken on the three attributes that were deemed by the CEO to be most important: closeness to customers, size of site and car parking facilities. Graphs for these analyses are shown in Appendix XXXX.

The outcomes of the analyses are as follows:

- If the weight of any attribute of interest is changed, Karabar continues to be the best choice, regardless of how high or low the new attribute weight is.
- During all the sensitivity analyses, none of the alternate sites are able to compete at all with the benefit value of Karabar, with the exception of Bungendore Place, when the weight of the size attribute drops to 0.

Overall, it can be concluded that the SMART process for deciding between office sites is robust against changes to the most important attributes.
