In the case of Samuel Jackson vs CXC Construction Company, Mr Jackson, after initially claiming $1.5 million in damages, has offered to settle for $750,000. The legal representative of CXC Construction, Howard Insurance, has two options; the first is to accept the offer and settle for $750,000, and the second is to make a counter-offer of $400,000. 

This is considerably lower than the $750,000 claimed, but if Mr Jackson accepts it, then CXC Construction will have saved a substantial amount of money. However, precisely because this counter-offer is so low, there is only a small chance of him accepting it.

(a)

Surprisingly, the best decision is for Howard Insurance to make the $400,000 counter-offer. Mr Jackson's possible responses are as follows:

- There is a 40% chance of Mr Jackson rejecting the offer and going immediately to trial. If this happens, the expected damages bill (when the three possible jury decisions are weighted against their probabilities) will be $825,000.
- The more likely outcome, with a 50% chance of occurring, is that Mr Jackson will make a new counter-offer of $600,000. At this point, a second decision must be made, on whether to accept this counter-offer or to go to trial, where the expected outcome is again $825,000. Here, the best choice would be to accept the $600,000 counter-offer and avoid the trial.
- The least likely scenario, at 10%, is that Mr Jackson accepts the $400,000 counter-offer.

The expected damages bill, when these three responses are weighted against their probabilities, is $670,000. This means that ultimately, making the $400,000 counter-offer is likely turn out cheaper than accepting the $750,000.

This recommendation is validated by the decision tree shown in Figure XXXX. This tree depicts all the decisions that Howard Insurance is required to make on behalf of CXC Construction, as well as all the possible outcomes of those decisions. Starting at the final outcomes, the expected damages at each branch are calculated by weighting the outcomes against their probabilities. These are back-propagated until the start of the tree is reached, where the recommended decision path, and its expected cost, become apparent.

Once a $400,000 counter-offer is made, Mr Jackson will respond in one of three ways; these are listed above. Two of these responses will lead to a final outcome with no further input required by Howard Insurance:

- Mr Jackson unexpectedly accepts the $400,000 settlement, thereby limiting the final cost to this relatively small amount. 

- Mr Jackson is sufficiently aggrieved to terminate negotiations and go immediately to trial. As discussed earlier, the expected outcome of this scenario is a $825,000 damages bill.

However, the third possible response, which is a $600,000 counter-offer, will require a second decision to be made; whether to accept the offer or go to trial. As discussed earlier, the expected damages bill after a trial is $825,000, which is substantially higher than the $600,000 payout. 

Therefore, once a $400,000 counter-offer has been made, the recommendation is to accept any future counter-offer and avoid a trial.
