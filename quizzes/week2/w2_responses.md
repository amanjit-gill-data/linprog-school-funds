##### rough notes

Risks taken:

Quit uni and the high likelihood of stable income for a single 15000 investment

Box.com had already started. Not a lot of competition, but no guarantee that this competitor wouldn't overtake them

Apple offered to buy it. Wanted to integrate it into their operating system. Claimed it's not a product, it's a feature. Declined, taking the chance that whatever Apple would offer (turned out to be iCloud) would be tethered to the Mac OS ecosystem which would slow down its growth (what was MacOS's market share at the time?).

Risks have generally paid off. Most successful startup ever seeded by Y Combinator. Despite security issues, it's found a place in a cloud storage market dominated by products that serve an advertising and data collection ecosystem. Turns out that its stated weakness of trying to be a standalone product, independent of a larger ecosystem like Office 365 or Google, is actually a selling point to a segment of the market.

Decisions:

- Attempt to sell a product relying on a workflow that didn't exist at the time
- Give up stable income for 15000
- Give up qualifications and earning capacity for 15000
- Accept or reject Jobs' offer i.e. integrate or remain independent

Possible outcomes:
- Fail to secure investments beyond the 15000; get normal jobs, finish uni
- Apple releases a cloud storage solution before they do and makes it impossible for Dropbox to attract publicity at launch
- Apple releases their solution afterwards, but is still able to use its clout to force market domination

decision alternatives:
- capital motors
- lennox motors
- john automotive

states of nature (outcomes):
- 12000 km per year
- 15000 km per year
- 18000 km per year

cost calculation:
- fixed fee + excess kms fee
- fixed fee = monthly fee x 36
- excess kms fee = 0 (if no excess kms) or \#excess kms x fee per km
