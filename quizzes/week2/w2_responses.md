#### rough notes

Risks taken:

Quit uni and the high likelihood of stable income for a single 15000 investment

Apple offered to buy it. Wanted to integrate it into their operating system. Claimed it's not a product, it's a feature. Declined, taking the chance that whatever Apple would offer (turned out to be iCloud) would be tethered to the Mac OS ecosystem which would slow down its growth (what was MacOS's market share at the time?).

Risks have generally paid off. Most successful startup ever seeded by Y Combinator. Despite security issues, it's found a place in a cloud storage market dominated by products that serve an advertising and data collection ecosystem. Turns out that its stated weakness of trying to be a standalone product, independent of a larger ecosystem like Office 365 or Google, is actually a selling point to a segment of the market.

Decisions:

- Attempt to sell a product relying on a workflow that didn't exist at the time
- Give up stable income for 15000
- Give up qualifications and earning capacity for 15000
- Accept or reject Jobs' offer i.e. integrate or remain independent


How future states were identified:
- the possible outcomes would have been obvious because by then, the internet revolution and dot com bubble had already happened, and the silicon valley venture capitalist culture was already a mature process, so the modes of success and failure were well understood. Also, in this high stakes environment, there are really only two overarching outcomes: incredible fame and fortune, and failure and obscurity.

Possible outcomes:

Stage 1:
- Fail to secure investments beyond the 15000; 
- Successfully secure funding and launch product

Stage 2:
- Succeed in building a market for a workflow that doesn't yet exist
- Fail to create a market

Stage 3:
- Market is created, but Apple's competing product dominates
- Market is created, and Apple's competing product doesn't siphon market share away


Which criterion?
Minimax regret, as the stakes are potentially very high - financial ruin/backruptcy, vs extreme wealth - so there is a lot of potential opportunity loss (leading to regret) to consider.
Actually, mentions risk and probs - choose something else?

How probs were determined:
- would have been aware of facts, like most startups fail. This would have given them an idea of low vs high probs. Figures like this have been explicitly studied and are known. On the other hand, the chances of Apple beating them to the market would not be known at all, and may have been considered a 50-50 gamble


Data sources:
- statistics on startup successes and failures
- job market for CS/Eng graduates
- salaries for early-career cs/eng professionals
- financial growth in startups that succeed

#### submission

The developers of the cloud storage service, Dropbox, considered the risk that their business idea would fail, leaving them unemployed and bankrupt. Ultimately, their decision to pursue innovation paid off.

(a) In 2007, they had to choose between finding IT jobs, or developing Dropbox full-time. They knew Dropbox would fail unless they could attract investors. The future states were thus clear:

- fail to attract investors; end up unemployed and bankrupt
- successfully attract investors, then fail to build a market
- successfully attract investors, then succeed in building a market

(b) Statistics show that most IT startups fail. This would have allowed the developers to estimate a very low probability of attracting investors and building a market.

(c) If investors relied solely on probabilities, then startups would rarely secure funding, and innovation would rarely occur. Therefore, I'd use a non-probability method, like minimax regret, as this would account for the large costs (bankruptcy) and very large payoffs (billion-dollar revenues) that characterise IT ventures.

(d) The developers likely considered the following data:
- competitor activity (whether others were developing similar products)
- economic conditions (likelihood of attracting investors) 
- salaries for IT employees, compared to salaries of successful startup founders

decision alternatives:
- capital motors
- lennox motors
- john automotive

states of nature (outcomes):
- 12000 km per year
- 15000 km per year
- 18000 km per year

cost calculation:
- fixed fee + excess kms cost
- fixed fee = monthly fee x 36
- excess kms cost = 0 (if no excess kms) or excess kms x cost per km
