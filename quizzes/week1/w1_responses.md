#### (a)

A high prevalence of COVID-19 in the community caused staff shortages in workplaces. When addressing these shortages, the Victorian state government incorrectly identified the isolation requirements as the problem, not the high infection rates in the community.

The accepted solution was to reduce, and then remove, isolation requirements; but this may have exacerbated staff shortages by causing more people to become infected.

#### (b)

One could compare the total number of COVID-19-related absences across the workforce, both before and after the rule changes. This might be estimated by:

- collecting depersonalised tallies of the medical certificates issued by GPs for COVID-19
- asking businesses to tally staff absences

One might also:

- survey businesses that persisted with stricter isolation policies even after the government's changes, in order to compare their absence rates to businesses with no isolation policies at all
- survey industry bodies to eliminate non-illness-related causes for shortages, such as pandemic-related immigration restrictions affecting availability of labour

#### (c)

If it were established that staff shortages were exacerbated, and not reduced, by removing isolation requirements, one could write a formal report to the Victorian Departments of Health, explaining the findings and making a recommendation to review current settings.

#### (d)

The data used to model staff absence rates can be used as an input into a decision analytics technique, such as those required for Task 3, the output of which would form the basis of a recommendation to be made to the state government.

#### (a)

As a teacher in the public school system, I observed curriculum creep, by which the curriculum continually grows in terms of teachable content, but with no corresponding increase in teaching time. I believe this may be contributing to a decline in academic performance, as students are expected to understand, consolidate and apply new knowledge in a shorter time, with fewer opportunities for practice and experimentation.

EBDM (evidence-based decision-making) can help establish whether curriculum creep - or other factors - are contributing to the decline in student achievement. EBDM provides a framework for acquiring, appraising and aggregating existing studies pertaining to educational attainment, as well as its augmentation by primary data, likely collected from schools, educators, students and parents. The output of this process would be a recommendation on whether or not the curriculum should be made smaller; and if it is made smaller, this would be followed by post-implementation data collection and a review of the impacts.

#### (b)

Some of the literature on education is not directly relevant to certain large demographic groups, such as families from non-English-speaking backgrounds. Because of this, extra attention would need to be paid to the appraisal of data sources, to check their relevance to a wide range of demographics; and there would likely need to be a significant effort spent on the collection of primary data to supplement coverage of these groups.
