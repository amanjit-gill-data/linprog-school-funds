misidentified as: staff shortages due to isolation of cases and close contacts

the real problem was that high prevalence of covid in the community was causing staff shortages; but the symptom - absence due to isolation - was misidentified as the problem needing to be resolved

so the accepted solution was to reduce, and then remove, isolation requirements; but, rather than solve staff shortages, I believe this solution may have exacerbated them by causing more of the workforce to be infected

#### (b)

I would try to calculate the total number of days employees across the workforce were absent due to covid, both before and after the policy changes. this would be difficult as some of these absences would not be documented as due to covid, but estimates could be made by:

- collecting depersonalised tallies of the medical certificates issued by GPs for illnesses related to covid
- asking businesses to add up staff absences both before and after the policy changes; a wide range of businesses from different industries would need to be canvassed, to eliminate bias due to some industries experiencing more serious shortages than others
- surveying businesses that retained stricter isolation policies even after the government's changes, in order to compare their staff absence patterns to businesses that removed isolation requirements

When surveying businesses, I would also collect data to rule out causes for shortages, other than illness, such as pandemic-related immigration policy affecting availability of workers, attrition due to factors such as low wages or poor working conditions

#### (c)

If I did indeed find that staff shortages were exacerbated, and not resolved, by changing isolation requirements, I would write a formal report to the Victorian and federal departments of health, explaining my findings and making a recommendation to revise current settings.

#### (d)

The data used to model staff absence patterns can be used as an input into a decision analytics technique, such as those described in Task 3, the output of which would form the basis of a recommendation to be made to state and federal governments.

#### (a)

As a teacher in the public school system, I observed curriculum creep, by which the curriculum of a school (or school system) continually grows in terms of teachable content, but with no corresponding increase in teaching time. That is, schools and educators are expected to fit more content into the same (or less) instruction time.

I believe that this may be contributing to a decline in academic performance, as students are expected to understand, consolidate and apply new knowledge in a shorter time, with fewer opportunities for practice and experimentation.

EBDM (evidence-based decision-making) can help me to establish whether curriculum creep - or other factors - are contributing to the decline in student performance. EBDM provides a framework for acquiring, appraising and aggregating existing studies pertaining to school education, as well as its augmentation by primary data, likely collected from schools, educators, students and parents. The output of this process would be a recommendation on whether or not the curriculum should be made smaller; and if it is made smaller, this would be followed by post-implementation primary data collection and a review of the impacts.

#### (b)

Some of the literature on education - in research papers and books - is not directly relevant to certain large demographic groups, such as first- and second-generation immigrants and low-SES communities. Because of this, extra attention would need to be paid to the appraisal of data sources, to ensure their relevance to a wide range of demographics; and there would likely need to be a significant effort spent on the collection of primary data to supplement the published material.
